# Homework 3: Iterator exercise

Implement the following three methods in iterators.cpp:

   selectionSort: sort the provided range using selection sort
   reverseRange: reverse the range
   printRange: print the range

Do not modify the test code in each function. You can look at that code for some ideas for implementing the methods.
