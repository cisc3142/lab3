# Homework 3: Iterator exercise

Implement the following three methods in iterators.cpp:

   selectionSort: sort the provided range using selection sort
   reverseRange: reverse the range
   printRange: print the range

Do not modify the test code in each function. You can look at that code for some ideas for implementing the methods.

Note: This is an exercise on iterators, so use their basic functionality (increment, decrement, dereference, compare) to implement the functions yourself. Do not call standard library functions to do loops on the given ranges for you. 
Also, note that selectionSort is to operate in place, without making a copy of the data, while for reverseRange you can make use of the data copy it makes (though you still have to reverse the original range).
